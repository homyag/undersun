Buildings A and B are designed for those who want to enjoy long days in this tropical paradise, while Building C is aimed at active people seeking adventure and new experiences. The apartments in the building in the "Rhythm" embody the principles of minimalism and geometry. The simplicity of the shapes and the rigor of the lines create an atmosphere of calm and order, while the soft textures of the furniture invite you to relax and enjoy the comfort. The combination of mass-produced furniture with unique design pieces gives the space personality and style. The color palette of the B case is based on warm gray and matte white shades, creating a cozy and relaxing atmosphere. This cosmopolitan range is ideal for residents of large cities who seek harmony and inspiration in their daily lives. The main focus in the decoration is on natural materials — wood and stone, which add warmth and naturalness. The steel and ferrous metal elements used in switches, lamps and furniture give the interior a modern character and a stylish accent.</p>\r\n<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Location</span></h2>\r\n<p>A TOP location in Phuket's prestigious and picturesque Bang Tao area, where you can enjoy stunning views of the Andaman Sea and relax by the numerous small lakes near the coast.
